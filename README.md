# Disclaimer

This repository is the output of a free Udacity course called Javascript Testing and its intent is to demonstrate the student's progress.

In order to finish the course, the student had to write his first test suite focused on the AddressBook sample mini project.

Handwritten code (by student) can be found in files "spec/AddressBookSpec.js", "src/AddressBook.js" and "src/Contact.js".

Rest of the files include originally provided coded (by Udacity).
